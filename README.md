The purpose of this project is to create data visulizations based off of a major metro paper. In particular, we will analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as create charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understanding findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. In particular, the data will focus on information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
